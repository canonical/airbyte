# NetSuite SuiteQL Source

This connector replicates configured NetSuite tables through SuiteQL REST web
services. It generates the SuiteQL itself so configurations cannot project,
aggregate, alias, or otherwise transform source data.

This is separate from `source-netsuite`, which discovers and reads NetSuite
objects through the Record API. SuiteQL has a different endpoint, response
shape, schema-discovery strategy, and configuration workflow.

## Supports: 

- NetSuite token-based OAuth 1 authentication with HMAC-SHA256
- Multiple tables in one source configuration
- Connector-generated `SELECT *` queries
- Offset pagination with a configurable page size
- Runtime JSON schema inference from the first returned row
- Full-refresh syncs
- Incremental syncs with deduplication

## Configuration

The connector requires an enabled NetSuite REST Web Services integration and a
token-based authentication access token with permission to query the requested
records.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `realm` | Yes | NetSuite account ID, such as `2344535` or `2344535_SB1`. |
| `consumer_key` | Yes | Integration consumer key. |
| `consumer_secret` | Yes | Integration consumer secret. |
| `token_key` | Yes | Access token ID. |
| `token_secret` | Yes | Access token secret. |
| `tables` | Yes | One or more table definitions containing `table_name`, `primary_key`, and `cursor_field`. |
| `page_size` | No | Rows requested per page, from 1 to 1000. Defaults to 1000. |

Table names, primary-key fields, and cursor fields must start with a letter or
underscore and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. Table names
must be unique and are also used as Airbyte stream names.

Example configuration using non-production placeholders:

```json
{
  "realm": "<account_id>",
  "consumer_key": "<consumer_key>",
  "consumer_secret": "<consumer_secret>",
  "token_key": "<token_id>",
  "token_secret": "<token_secret>",
  "tables": [
    {
      "table_name": "transaction",
      "primary_key": ["id"],
      "cursor_field": "lastmodifieddate"
    }
  ],
  "page_size": 1000
}
```

Keep credentials in an untracked `.secrets/config.json` file. Do not commit
real account IDs, tokens, or consumer secrets.

## Sync Behavior

The connector sends each generated query as a `POST` request to
`/services/rest/query/v1/suiteql` with the required `Prefer: transient` header.
It returns the response `items` as records and follows NetSuite's `hasMore`,
`offset`, and `count` fields until all available pages have been read.

Discovery executes each generated query and infers its stream schema from a
sample of returned rows. An empty result therefore produces a stream
with an open, empty object schema until a row is available on a later discovery.
NetSuite may normalize result field aliases to lowercase.

Every table supports full refresh and incremental sync with destination
deduplication. Each table config contains:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `primary_key` | One or more selected fields that uniquely identify each record. |
| `cursor_field` | A date or timestamp field used for stream state and incremental filtering. |

The connector owns the query shape. For `transaction`, `id`, and
`lastmodifieddate`, it generates the equivalent of:

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  TO_CHAR(lastmodifieddate, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS cursor_ts
FROM transaction
WHERE lastmodifieddate >= TO_DATE(?, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')
ORDER BY cursor_ts, id
```

The fixed-width `cursor_ts` alias avoids account-specific date rendering and is
used for Airbyte state. Incremental reads add the matching inclusive predicate
`lastmodifieddate >= TO_DATE(?, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')`; boundary records may
be read again and are safely deduplicated by the configured primary key.

NetSuite REST SuiteQL returns at most 100,000 rows per query. Use
SuiteAnalytics Connect when a query must return more data.

## Local Development

Install dependencies and list the available workflow targets:

```bash
make install
make help
```

Run the standard local validation sequence:

```bash
make unit-test
make integration-test
make connector-test
make build
make spec
```

Create an untracked `.secrets/config.json` containing real NetSuite credentials
before running live protocol commands. These commands use `CONFIG`, `CATALOG`,
and `STATE` Make variables, which can be overridden for another test fixture.

```bash
make check
make discover
make read
```

Run the Airbyte CI acceptance workflow after preparing its Poetry environment:

```bash
cd ../../../airbyte-ci/connectors/pipelines
poetry install
cd ../../../airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-netsuite-suiteql
make test
```

The committed acceptance configuration validates the connector specification
without credentials. Live acceptance checks require a local
`.secrets/config.json` with permission to query the configured tables.
